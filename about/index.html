    <h1 id="boring-part-about-programming-and-career">Boring part about programming and career</h1>

<p>I am an ordinary programmer like the ones you see every day: beard, backpack with a laptop and so on. I stated my career in 2011 as
embedded Linux programmer at UZPS factory, Ufa city. I still love Linux and use Lenovo laptop as my working machine.
Anyway, at my fist job I got experience with C++, Qt, QML and some kinds of tricky libs and tools. I got understending
of cross-compilation and building different stuff for rare Linux distributions and achitectures. It was very helpful
when I worked in <a href="http://www.roadar.ru/">RoadAR</a>: I had some tasks about build RoadAR’s CV software for different
(sometimes outdated) Linux distributions and (oh…)Windows.</p>

<p>I moved to Kazan in 2013. UZPS’s management killed our media platform, so almost all programmers left the company in 3-4 months.
I started my career from the very beginning: I learned Ruby On Rails and became a full stack Rails developer. From mid-2013
to mid-2015 I worked in Raccoons Group - an ordinary outsource company. I got experience with Ruby: backend architecture, Rails
patterns and antipatterns, non-related to Rails ruby programming. We made some tricky integrations between Ruby software
and MS ActiveDirectory and 1C(russian accounting software). Virtually, tasks wasn’t very interesting and the salary wasn’t
very big, so I left the company.</p>

<p>I worked in RoadAR from mid-2015 to mid-2016 and it was very iteresting. They hired me for the role of Rails programmer.
Theirs previous programmer received a green card and moved to USA. For the first time I developed backend and
administration interface for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.roadar.android">RoadAR</a>. There were
many intersting tasks related to Postgres query optimization, high loaded Sidekiq and PostGIS. Some time later
company started a project for car licence plate recognition and my C++ and building skills became usefull again. I had been
a some kind of release-engeneer for that project: all my сolleagues were zealous Mac users without Linux experience. I moved
building system from Xcode to CMake and persuaded everybody to use it. Then I made this <a href="https://github.com/zhulik/bubing">tool</a>
which helped me to build self-sufficient bundles of linux software and run it on any distribution. Actually I didn’t want
to work with low-level stack like C++/OpenCV, so I thoutght about chaning my job again, but I still help them by supporting
server infrastructure and with small web projects.</p>

<p>From the beginning of 2017 and until now I work <a href="http://mechanizm.io">here</a>.</p>

<h1 id="interesting-part-about-hobbies">Interesting part about hobbies</h1>
<h2 id="music">Music</h2>
<p>From an early age I was interested in rock and heavy music. My favorite bands:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Scandinavian
    <ul>
      <li>In flames</li>
      <li>Children Of Bodom</li>
      <li>Scar Symmetry</li>
      <li>Malrun</li>
      <li>Immportal</li>
      <li>Abbath</li>
      <li>I</li>
      <li>Ghost B. C.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>German
    <ul>
      <li>In Extremo</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>British
    <ul>
      <li>Iron maiden</li>
      <li>Motorhead</li>
      <li>Anterior</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Italian
    <ul>
      <li>Fleshgod Apocalypse</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>American
    <ul>
      <li>Slipknot</li>
      <li>Godsmack</li>
      <li>Disturbed</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>When I was 18 I started learning to play drums. After 1 year of learning I found my first band(melodic-death/power),
we gave a few conserts and broke up. Then I participated in soft-rock band of my friends, and gave few concerts with them.
And the last band I participated in was old-school death metal band. After relocation to Kazan I didn’t find an interesting
band there, so I abandoned music. Anyway I do programming better than music=). I still have habit of knoking on the table
and stomping in tact of music I’m listening to.</p>

<h2 id="travels">Travels</h2>

<p>My first abroad travel was in 2012. It was a trip to several europenian countries: Czech Republic, France and Italy. As It was
my first abroad experience I was very inspired and a little bit frightened, but everything has happened well.
We drank beer in Prague, saw Eiffel Tower at night in Paris, swam in Adriatic Sea in Riomaggiore и were dying from the heat in Rome.
An incredible adventure!</p>

<p>The next thip happend in 2013. My friend called me in My and told “Hey! There is very cheap tickets from Moscow to Berin
in October! Do I get a ticket for you?”. I answered yes and It costed me my studies at the university. As it turned out later -
I had a session in my university right on days of our trip. I was expelled from the university. This time we visited
Berlin, Dresden, Prague(Beer!, beer!), Amsterdam(Weed!, Weed!), Dusseldorf and Cologne. There, in Cologne I went to the
In Extemo show for the first time. It was awesome! Europenian headbangers community is entirely different from Russian one.
In Russia you usually see drunk and unwashed youth near the scene. In Europe on the show we saw people aged from 16 to
nearly 70(maybe, older, I don’t know), and they were very polite and friendly! But they were drunk too=). After returning
I went to university and recovered. That’s why I studied at the university for so long.</p>

<p>Trips in 2017 will be described in future posts.</p>
